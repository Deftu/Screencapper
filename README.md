## Taking a screenshot in vanilla Minecraft
I take a screenshot, I need to either navigate
to the screenshot folder myself, copy my screenshot
to my clipboard and send it wherever I want. But
sometimes, you can't even send the image directly,
so you need to upload it to an image hosting service
first.

## Taking a screenshot using Screencapper
I take a screenshot, I get to see a preview of it,
I can automatically upload it to my image hosting
service or copy it to my clipboard.

## Why use this instead of Shotify?
This mod was mostly rewritten using Shotify
as a somewhat sturdy base. It has a few slight
performance improvements, a few small feature
tweaks and additions and adds support for
uploading your screenshots to ShareX image
hosts.

The original Shotify mod has also been effectively
abandoned indefinitely, so it will not be updated
to 1.19 and newer versions. This mod will be updated
for the forseeable future.

## But [Essential][essential] has this mod built-in, why should I use this?!
Essential's implementation is buggy at best, and causes
incompatibilities with other mods (such as this one). I
wouldn't recommend supporting their implementation, nor
would I recommend supporting them in general.
