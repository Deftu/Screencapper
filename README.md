## Taking a screenshot in vanilla Minecraft
I take a screenshot, I need to either navigate
to the screenshot folder myself, copy my screenshot
to my clipboard and send it wherever I want. But
sometimes, you can't even send the image directly,
so you need to upload it to an image hosting service
first.

## Taking a screenshot using Screencapper
I take a screenshot, I get to see a preview of it,
I can automatically upload it to my image hosting
service or copy it to my clipboard.
